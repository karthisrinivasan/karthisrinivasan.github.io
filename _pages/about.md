- I'm a first year PhD student at Yale University, in the [Electrical Engineering department](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering), advised by [Prof. Rajit Manohar](https://csl.yale.edu/~rajit/).
- My research interests lie broadly in the fields of asynchronous circuits, neuromorphic engineering and analog design.
