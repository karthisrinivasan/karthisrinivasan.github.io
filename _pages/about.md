- I'm a third year PhD candidate at Yale University, in the [Electrical Engineering department](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering), advised by [Prof. Rajit Manohar](https://csl.yale.edu/~rajit/).
- My research interests lie broadly in the field of asynchronous circuits. In particular, I'm interested in optimization and synthesis of self-timed circuits from abstract concurrent programs.
